# Modular Cells

This is a hobby project made in Unity where a game starts with just 1 cell, which then will feed and divide into more cells.

This cycle repeats indefinetely, where each new cell will add on a new modular part. This modular part can be movement speed, an offensive part etc.

Ultimately the strongest generation will survive, and if this generation exceeds a certain percentage of the whole population, 90% of them will be erased and the cycle will repeat.
